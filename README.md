## 🧔Advice

Here are a few suggestions for those who wish to excel in this field.

- Be consistent and persistent.
- Every step of the ladder is significant for you to reach your goal. Do not skip a single step thinking you can cover it later on.
- Do not engage yourself learning multiple things at a time. You will end up losing interest in SQA 😔
- **"Slow and steady wins the race."** Utilize your time in understanding the concepts instead of completing the journey.
- You can follow my **FREL priniciple** 😉. Find 🤔, Read 📖, Explore 🤯, Learn 🏫!

### Happy Learning!😊
