## Advice
Here are a few suggestions for those who wish to excel in this field.

- Be consistent and persistent.
- Every step of the ladder is significant for you to reach your goal. Do not skip a single step thinking you can cover it later on.
- Do not engage yourself learning multiple things at a time. You will end up losing interest 😔
- **"Slow and steady wins the race."** Utilize your time in understanding the concepts instead of completing the journey.
  
### Happy Learning! 😊
