## 🧔Advice

Here are a few suggestions for those who wish to excel in this field.

- Never ever skip any step thinking this is not important for me. Every step carries its own importance and is equally important while learning.
- Do no engage yourself in learning multiple steps simultaneously. This will lead to a havoc and you might end up losing interest in SQA 😔
- Always remember, "Slow and steady wins the race." Utilize your time in understanding the concepts instead of completing the journey.
- Stay consistent and persistent while learning.
- Try to explore new things during your learning phase. Try to think out of the box and learn new things.
